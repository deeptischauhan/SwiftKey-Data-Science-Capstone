                The goal is to use the text that has already been typed to 
                predict the next word.  This is commonly known as auto-complete.
                As a user types, auto-complete gives the user several possible words options 
                based on probable words that come after the last word or phrase.
                The R package \"wordprediction\" allows this functionality."),
